There have been some attempts to make individual HFT(High Freqency Trading) in the KRX(Korea Exchange).
However, it is common to say that it is impossible due to high fees, low accessibility and latency.
Therefore, thought that only a few of companies that can solve these problems are doing business.

To explain the problems further,
1. low accessibility and high fees
Because the Korea Exchange grants trading authority only to certain big companies, Individual Trader must ust that companies's API to trade. And also, Those APIs are designed based on Windows OS. In general, HFT is based on Linux development enviroment. This makes individual HFT harder. And Individual Trader have to pay higer fees than companies.

2. High Latency, Low Speed
HFT(High Frequency Trading) needs both Low Latency and High speed. It is hard for individual trader to solve that ploblems, Because most investors are located far away and have slow network speeds. Otherwise investment companies are located close to the exchange and use dedicated lines.
