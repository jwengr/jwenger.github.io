## There have been some attempts to make individual HFT(High Freqency Trading) in the KRX(Korea Exchange). However, It is common to say that it is impossible due to high fees, low accessibility and latency. Therefore, It is thought that only few companies can solve these problems are doing business.

## To explain the problems further,

## 1. low accessibility and high fees  
### Because the Korea Exchange grants trading authority only to certain big companies, Individual Trader must ust that companies's API to trade. And also, Those APIs are designed based on Windows OS. In general, HFT is based on Linux development enviroment. This makes individual HFT harder. And Individual Trader have to pay higer fees than companies.

## 2. High Latency, Low Speed  
### HFT(High Frequency Trading) needs both Low Latency and High speed. It is hard for individual trader to solve that ploblems, Because most investors are located far away and have slow network speeds. Otherwise investment companies are located close to the exchange and use dedicated lines.

## How you can fix it?
### First of all, you can't fix that ploblems perfectly. But you can try to imitate it similarly. Using Cloud Computing system such as AWS, Azure, You can build a development environment with lower latency than before. It's still high, of course. And it's not real HFT.

## In this project, I will build and practice the HFT trading environment consisting of AWS, Linux and Windows. I don't have much knowledge of HFT, and I know the results will be not good. My goal is to imitate HFT through this project and improve programming skills.
